# Make the camera movable

- Tiles move properly
- Entities move properly
- Dragging grid works great
- Building now works
- Entities and tiles aren't draw if off the screen.
- Other views are working great too now
- The bottom and right bar now properly scale nicely, and are more OOP, only thing missing is click detection.
- The right bar now also doesn't redraw every tick.
- The save world screen is 90% done, the title doesn't dynamically change, and we probably need a back button.

- As long as it's a big square, everything works, the overlays work great now, and the menus scale 90%,
- Need to make the main menus scale nicer (everything works actually, apart from main menu, potentially because it never gets the new values?)

- Currently, expansion works great, but doesn't include the perlin noise, maybe make it all dirt or something? Also need to make the regen world not do it if it's a bad number
- For the expansion, obviously we need to loop until we don't get a bad number from the perlin noise, but also, we can generate an entire bigger perlin noise grid (slow, I know), and then cut out the edge

- Mess around with non-square worlds
- Investigate pausing?

- Generating a huuuuge perlin noise function is essentially instant, so maybe change the perlin noise width and height to instead take a subsection of a bigger slice, that way when we're expanding, we just take a bigger slice? I guess it's just generating the biome right, so we can re-generate the base material using biome_to_tile.
- Maybe we can make a 3x3 grid of worlds, just in case I ever want to add multiple worlds or something, I don't think lag will work with bigger than 96 worlds?
- The perlin function seems to take width and height into account for more than just size of array, like bigger maps have less detail.
- I should swap out the perlin noise function for one that takes coords...
- The perlin noise function now takes coords, after I've ported to the new system, but still scales weirdly?
- Hmmm the perlin function seems to act more differently if the original set is different? Perhaps?

- The recursion limit needs to be changed depending on world size, and I guess pathfinding is going to struggle way more on bigger worlds.

- Currently, the new world menu doesn't save, intentionally, should I change this?
- Move on_tick back to the main function? Most functionality has been moved anyway.
- Save menu needs dynamic title sizing

- To make non-square grids, we need to swap around a bunch of map_width and map_heights probably
