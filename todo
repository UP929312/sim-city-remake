# Make the camera movable

- The recursion limit needs to be changed depending on world size, and I guess pathfinding is going to struggle way more on bigger worlds.

Somehow make menus update in real time to changes in size of window?

Make scrolling in the load game menu scroll the index?

The route cache doesn't work, it just dies after a while, maybe I could even bake it into the level somehow, I guess expansion would break that.

Change biome to be height map, and then use biome for snow, sand, that kind of thing
For old maps, regenerate a new set of biome and height_map values

Instead of random key binds, a dev menu with more buttons and stuff

A dev fire button, maybe even a dev toggle which enables the fire and stuff?
The map width and height info, the money button, expansion button should also be in dev menu, as should the dev fire button, and the dev toggle button
