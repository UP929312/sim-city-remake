# Make the camera movable

- Tiles move properly
- Entities move properly
- Dragging grid works great
- Building now works
- Entities and tiles aren't draw if off the screen.
- Other views are working great too now

- Possible option for more tiles in the new world menu?
- As long as it's a big square, everything works, the overlays work great now, and the menus scale 90%,
- Need to make the right side bar work for bigger screen sizes, and figure out how to set a minimum
- Bottom layer now scales nicely, never implemented the clicking for changing the view, might return, might not?
- Right icons now scale properly, with more or less being shown
- Need to make the main menus scale nicer (everything works actually, apart from main menu, potentially because it never gets the new values?)
- Currently, expansion works great, but doesn't include the perlin noise, maybe make it all dirt or something? Also need to make the regen world not do it if it's a bad number
- For the expansion, obviously we need to loop until we don't get a bad number from the perlin noise, but also, we can generate an entire bigger perlin noise grid (slow, I know), and then cut out the edge

- Mess around with non-square worlds
- Investigate pausing

- Somehow move the entry road out, since it'll get stuck near the middle when you expand, maybe add more than one eventually.
